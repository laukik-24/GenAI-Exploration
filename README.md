# 🚀 GenAI Engineering Lab  

> From experimenting with AI tools → to engineering production-ready Generative AI systems.

---

## 📌 Overview  

This repository documents my structured journey into **Generative AI (GenAI)**, focusing on practical implementation, system design, and production-oriented AI engineering.

Rather than just using LLM APIs, this repo explores:

- Structured outputs & schema validation
- Prompt engineering strategies
- LLM orchestration with LangChain
- Backend + AI integration
- Early-stage RAG pipelines
- Controlled, reliable AI system design

This repository represents my transition into becoming a **GenAI Engineer**.

## 📈 Engineering Focus  

This repository is built with a systems-first AI engineering mindset.

It emphasizes:

- Designing reliable AI systems  
- Enforcing strict output schemas using Pydantic  
- Minimizing LLM unpredictability through structured validation  
- Building reusable, modular AI components  
- Preparing workflows for production deployment  

Instead of just generating text, the focus is on:

> Controlled. Validated. System-integrated AI.

## 🔬 Learning Philosophy  

AI systems should not be treated as black boxes.

They should be:

- Predictable  
- Validated  
- Modular  
- Scalable  
- Production-ready  

This repository reflects that engineering philosophy — focusing on architecture and reliability rather than experimentation alone.

## 🎯 Roadmap  

- [ ] Build a mini RAG pipeline  
- [ ] Integrate a vector database (FAISS / Pinecone)  
- [ ] Deploy a GenAI REST API (FastAPI)  
- [ ] Build an AI-powered web interface  
- [ ] Experiment with multi-agent workflows  
- [ ] Add evaluation, logging & benchmarking

## 📊 Why This Repository Matters  

Many projects call LLM APIs.  
Few engineer them properly.

This repository demonstrates:

- Schema-enforced LLM outputs  
- Backend-ready AI architecture  
- Structured prompt engineering  
- Practical GenAI experimentation  
- A production-oriented mindset  

It showcases the transition from:

> API Usage → AI System Design
